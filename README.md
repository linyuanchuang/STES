This GitHub repository is only intended for the related code and data designed for the public paper "Sorption Thermal Energy Storage Performance of Nanoporous Metal-Organic Frameworks and Covalent-Organic Frameworks by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations". It mainly includes the Simulation folder and the Machine Learning folder.

The Simulation folder contains input files for GCMC (Grand Canonical Monte Carlo) simulations.

The Machine Learning folder includes clustering, t-SNE classification, PCA dimensionality reduction, and prediction for ΔW, <ΔadsH>, and Qed. For the machine learning prediction part, we have optimized the parameters of the algorithm, output the prediction data as a csv file, and then read and plotted the data through Python.
